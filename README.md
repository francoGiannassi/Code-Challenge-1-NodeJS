Code Challenge #1 - Node.js

Author: Franco Giannassi

This is my resolution for a code challenge using `Node.js`. 
The idea of this challenge is to build a `HTTP REST API` that meets the given requirements.
Also this project uses Express.js, Mongoose, Jwt and Bcrypt.
To start the server run the command `node src/index.js`.
